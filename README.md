### What I learned

In creating my entertainment web app using react, typeScript, node.js, styled Components, and redux. i explored into full-stack development, mastering both front-end and back-end sides, including user authentication and secure data storage. working with react and typeScript improved code quality. advance the backend with Node.js exposed me to server-side programming and data management. creating redux for state management enhanced my ability to efficiently manage complex application states. i became skilful in dynamic data handling, including filtering and displaying data to improve user experience. balancing functionality and aesthetics helped me create an intuitive and convenient design.
